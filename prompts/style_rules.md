# Style Rules (Hard Constraints)

## Tone & Texture
- Urban underworld, Northeast China texture (ice, old industry, debt-of-favor, rules).
- Strong-but-explainable: heightened grit/physicality/courage/means, but no magic, no invincible wins.
- Violence: non-graphic. Focus on rhythm, positioning, consequences, leverage. Avoid gore.

## Anti-AI Tell Rules
- No summary paragraphs, no moral lectures, no in conclusion.
- Avoid vague adjective piles (e.g., mysterious, grand, unbelievable).
- No narrator explaining the world; show via action, objects, constraints.
- No template jokes or repeating catchphrases. Dialogue must arise from context.

## Concrete Detail Policy (Density, Not Quota)
- Use concrete details as needed to make scenes believable, but do not check boxes.
- Prefer: object details, sensory cues, small logistics (time, distance, money, temperature).
- In high-tension scenes, details are brief and sharp; in slower scenes, details can breathe.

## Chapter Mechanics (Web-serial)
- Within the first ~300 words: establish goal or conflict.
- Middle: introduce a setback or misread.
- Late: reversal / hard推进 (a move that changes the board).
- End: a hook question that forces the next chapter.

## Character Consistency Rules
- If a character trigger_sensitivities happens, behavior MUST shift and must be observable via behavioral_tells.
- Any meaningful advancement must pay at least one cost in cost_mechanism (reputation / law_attention / relationship_damage / evidence_risk / moral_decay).

## Output Policy
- Output only the requested blocks and formats.
- No meta commentary. No as an AI.
